REMOVE FROM ANY OFFICIAL DEPLOYMENTS

hello
generate 'Hello World!'
- see glueCode (that I was going to use for Drupal Camp 2015)
--dev output hello_world_object
--punct= if value _is_ punctuation, swap it for exclamation.
--greeting= if value is in supported greetings use it
--who= swap out for 'World'
--case= if supported (or alias) then change the case of the --who (only)
v1.0 is basic
v1.1 is all above

DSM natural next step for Hello World -- that is, simple PHP vs Drupal Developer Tools

lorem
generate a Lorem Ipsum block
default = 1 paragraph 4 sentences
--para= number of para (limit 5 since it's a demo)
--sentmax= maximum number of sentences per paragraph
--sentmin= minimum number of sentences per paragraph
\_ will validate that max >= min
--vernacular= (BETTER WORD) (see fun sites) bacon, corporate etc

nodeplode
--count= number of nodes
\_ default is 1
--sort= supported sort criteria (title_asc, title_desc, nid_asc, nid_desc, rand, type[bundle]_asc, type[bundle]_desc)
\_ default is nid_asc
\_ Validate on count <= all nodes
\_ maybe roll out a full-on thrown error mechanism, reading

LAST Version, 'example' becomes 'project', also php-coder can become a module TEMPLATE when you know you will want to drush component

xDeBug! -> the initial thrust behind xdebug was all about executable code, not a debug mode of this or that IDE in debug mode. So think (try) to see how that may work.
