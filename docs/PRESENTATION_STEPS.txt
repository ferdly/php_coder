Outline of Live Demo Steps:

Example Hello

From the hello_example_simple

git checkout example_hello
\_ checout this example

All the same examples as before:
drush php-coder hello
drush phpc hello
drush phpc //wait for prompt

drush phpc --dev
\_ also will prompt
\_ BUT! The dev output is easier (IMHO) to manage than devel modules dpm
PAYOFF!
 - adding a drush command component(even for non-drush module) is great coding option
 - purposely NOT using Schlossnagle throw e error, but next I will
   \_ here is more of a 'home-cooked' development error catching: see unpack()
