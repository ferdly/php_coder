Outline of Live Demo Steps:

Example Hello

From the hello_example_simple

git checkout example_hello_select_debug
\_ checout this example

All the same examples as before:
drush php-coder hello
drush phpc hello
drush phpc //wait for prompt

GO TO CODE!
what we want to do is work with the '--select=' option
in php_coder_obejct, $option_select is either NULL, TRUE or FALSE
however, we pass the $options_array to the hello_object as well
even though we have already 'unpacked' and 'validated' select, rand, and dev in php_coder_object, that doesn't mean we can't ignore any of those in hello_object or extend to 'unpacking' and 'validating' additional options, or -- as we are now doing 'unpack' and 'validate' differently.
Specifically "--select=":
what we want is to gather TRUE or FALSE
(same as php_coder_object
    specifically, FALSE and NULL are differentiated without a difference )
additionally we want to accept any valid $composition_key. So that is in addition to existing True-False-Null.
1. False-Null and 'hello' have no effect
2. 'goodbye' (or any other extended options later) will simply run that option
3. True means that we need to code a New User Interface.

So what do we do as Coders?
There are no rules, here's what I've done
1. TEST our presumption that False-Null and 'hello' have no effect
    \_ pretty certain this is the case, but test anyway because coding changes of    any kind can result in bugs
2. TEST that our new code takes care of 'goodbye'
3. Save that for later
    \_ Not sure how to do a drush select (even though we have, but following tutorial). But I want to test that we "Get There" properly. So you do that by not writing ALL the code at once, but write enough so that you can "encapsulate" that new part either 'officially' (its own method) or unofficially (you will put it in procedurally, but you can test now that it is everything else is working).

Now: Just Do It!
1. run...
phpc //Null
phpc --select=no //False
phpc --select=hello
phpc --select=donkeykong //also Null, default since not True, False or in Greeting

2. run...
phpc --select=goodbye

3. run...
phpc --select=yes

QUESTIONS:
Here __OR__ Next (fully working 'hello_example' branch)
- Show --select=yes and rand=yes validation?
-


drush phpc --dev
\_ also will prompt
\_ BUT! The dev output is easier (IMHO) to manage than devel modules dpm
PAYOFF!
 - adding a drush command component(even for non-drush module) is great coding option
 - purposely NOT using Schlossnagle throw e error, but next I will
   \_ here is more of a 'home-cooked' development error catching: see unpack()
